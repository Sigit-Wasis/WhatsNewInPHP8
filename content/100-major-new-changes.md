# Major new changes

In this section, we will discuss new features introduced in PHP version 8.

It is not a book to learn PHP but Kapil's notes while going through new PHP 8 features, converted into a form of EBook. I assume you already know PHP and its features available till PHP version 7.4. Thus, without going into much theory, let's dive directly into changes and their examples.

Please note, in some sections, we will also discuss the history to understand features that came in older versions. It could be useful for those who are not aware or remember changes in PHP 7 or earlier versions. If you wish to skip the history, go to the title `Changes in PHP 8`.
